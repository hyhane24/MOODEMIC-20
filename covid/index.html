							<h2>Corona Blue: Another Virus</h2>
							<p><br>[ Inspiration… ] <br><br>

								COVID-19 has invaded the Earth. COVID-19 has immensely impacted the society not only physically but mentally. This is commonly referred to as "Corona Blue". While practicing quarantine and social distancing, people started to be mentally isolated, which caused depression, anxiety, and various mental disorders. Our team decided to develop a program that shows the correlation between people's mood changes and COVID-19 cases.
								
								<br><br> [ What it does? ] <br><br>
								
								Our program, MOODEMIC-20, is an analytical platform that compares data from CDC and Google Trend to demonstrate the positive correlation between search terms related to mood swings and weekly COVID-19 positive cases across the US. We used the IBM Watson Studio technique and IBM Cloud Pak for data visualization. Input data were parsed based on articles and public data published on US CDC, Google Trend, and psychology scholarly journals. We then integrated this data visualization in web development to create an agile user interface for viewing the correlation.

							<h2>MOODEMIC-20, Analytical Platform</h2>
							<p>  <br>[ How we built it? ]<br><br>

								We first collected data in .csv format and parsed this into JSON format using the IBM Watson and IBM Cloud Pak (IBM API) technology. This enabled the visualization of graphs that best reflect the correlation between mood switches and the COVID-19 pandemic. The axes of the graphs were weekly date and number of positive cases/prevalence of the search terms. The data were pre-processed to match these standards using the IBM technologies, changing the data types using machine learning. The visualized graphs were exported as JSON files and then integrated into our web platform built with JS, node.JS, HTML5, CSS, and chart.js. VSC software was used to build the UI of the web and Figma software was used to create graphical representations.
								
								
								<br><br>[ What's next for MOODEMIC-20? ]<br><br>
								
								We will automate the process of collecting data from public APIs to provide real-time analysis and visualization. We will also utilize deep learning experiments and AutoAI learning experiments features of IBM Watson studio to provide expected mental related data.</p>
